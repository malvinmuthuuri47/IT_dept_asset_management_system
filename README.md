# IT Asset Management System

<p>This project is meant to help IT departments in companies manage their assets (laptops) in terms of maintenance logs, digitizing the maintenance of the computers assigned to users. This eliminates the need ot have files dating back to yeears as keeping records in such a manner becomes an issue when it comes to looking at the history and lifecycle of a computer system.</p>
